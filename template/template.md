## Background
{{descriptive
You all live in Rivenshore, a small village nestled in a tight valley beneath towering mountains.  A river runs past the village and flows south to a distant bay.

}}

## Adventure Overview
This five-encounter adventure takes place...


\column

## Adventure Intro
{{descriptive
Today’s trouble starts...
You are all enjoying your weekly family dinner at the Block and Tackle tavern after a hard day of training.
“HELP, HELP!”
Everyone in the tavern stops eating and drinking as the Maeve, the innkeeper’s wife, bursts into the dining room from the basement.
“Rats, RATS, ENORMOUS RATS” and then, “and they’ve taken Roger!”
You all know Roger, he’s Maeve’s son and he helps out in the tavern.
“They’ve taken him down their hole.  Please, you kids get down there are get him back for me!”
There’s a moment of silence as all eyes look to you heroes.  Your parents encourage you.
“Okay kids, I hope you’re ready for your first adventure.”

## Encounter 1: Name of the Encounter

The first encounter...  
The heroes start...


### Map

![basement_map](https://rawcdn.githack.com/Krifto/HeroKidsStyle/main/assets/basement-map.png) {position:relative,top:20px,left:0px,width:4.72in}

\column

### Encounter Intro
Following the adventure intro, the heroes… :

{{descriptive
You put down your forks and spoons and pick up you weapons and equipment then follow Maeve to the entrance to the tavern’s basement.

The stairs descend into the dimly lit basement.  You immediately smell the stink of rats, even before you hear the patter of their unusually large paws.

As you step down into the basement you see flashes of movement as the rats scurry between the stacks barrels and grain throughout the basement.
}}

### Encounter Features

The main area of the basement has two stacks of barrels that cannot be climbed over or shot through (with ranged attacks).  The second room has a narrow path that forces the players to think about the positions of their heroes.

### Ability Tests
The players can have their heroes perform a number of ability tests:

- Intelligence (Perception) tests at difficulty 4 to hear Roger’s shouts in the distance.
- Intelligence (Knowledge/Lore) tests at difficulty 5 to know that the basement is often overrun by rats (but not usually this big).

### Monsters
This encounter features monsters that use melee and ranged attacks against the heroes.

### Tactics
The rats are gorging themselves on food scraps and won’t attack the heroes until they are attacked first.

### Conclusion
Once all of the monsters are KO’d, read (or paraphrase) this:
{{descriptive
With a screech, the final rat falls to the ground and then there is silence in the basement.

The silence is short-lived as you hear a distant call for help.  The cry seems to come from the broken floorboards in the south-west corner of the basement.


You look through the broken boards and see a dirt tunnel underneath the tavern’s basement.  Surely it leads to the rats’ den.
}}

If the heroes were damaged in combat then they can take a short rest to remove damage.

<br>

Continue to **Encounter 2: Ancient Cistern**.

## Encounter 1: Where Does This Cave Go!
The second encounter takes our heroes underground into the caves and caverns beneath the town.


The heroes enter from the bottom-left, and the monsters are not immediately visible.


### Map

\column

### Encounter Intro
When the heroes enter this area, read this:

{{descriptive
You carefully climb down into this tunnel beneath the tavern.  The ground is hard-packed under your feet, and the whole place smells like a giant rat’s toilet.

Large fungi grow from the walls and give off a soft blue light that illuminates a narrow tunnel to your east.
}}

### Encounter Features

A tight tunnel leads from the heroes’ starting location into a larger cave.  As the first hero enters the large room they will see the first three rats.  There is a raised ledge at the far east of the large cave.  This ledge is about 10’ high, so the heroes will need to come up with a way of climbing up it to continue deeper into the caves.
Additional rats can enter the fight from this ledge and jump down onto the heroes.

### Ability Tests
The players can have their heroes perform an Intelligence (Tracking) test at difficulty 4 which lets them see rat footprints that they can track to the east.

{{footerleft}}{{footercenter}}{{pageNumber,auto}}

### Monsters
This encounter features monsters that use melee and ranged attacks against the heroes.

## Encounter 3: Underground Choices!
The third encounter features a fight and then a choice for our heroes.

Here the heroes encounter more rats, and then once the rats have been defeated they can decide to continue to the north or the south.

### Map

\column

### Encounter Intro
When the heroes enter this area, read this:

{{descriptive
The high ledge leads to short narrow tunnel which quickly opens out into another large underground chamber.  You see tunnel exits from the chamber to the north and south, and a small dark hole in the north wall of the cave.

As you watch, a rat emerges from the hole, takes one look at you and then charges towards you with a ferocious shriek!

}}

### Encounter Features

The main unusual feature of this area is the short rat-hole between the main cavern and the small cave in the north.
You can use this cave to bring rats into the fight, or even to have rats run and hide from the heroes.


### Ability Tests
The players can have their heroes perform a number of ability tests:
- Intelligence (Tracking) tests let them see rat footprints that they can track to the north (this will give them a hint that the rats’ den is to the north, not the south).


{{footerleft}}{{footercenter}}{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page



### Monsters
This encounter features one or two rats for each of the heroes (or less if you like).  Bring the extra rats on from the north cave as the fight progresses.
{{monstertable

|:---------|:---------------------:|:-------------------------------------------------:|
| 1 Hero:    | 2 x Giant Rats      | {{ID1}}  {{ID2}}                                  |
| 2 Heroes:  | 3 x Giant Rats      | {{ID1}}  {{ID2}} {{ID3}} {{ID4}}                  |
| 3 Heroes:  | 4 x Giant Rats      | {{ID1}}  {{ID2}} {{ID3}} {{ID4}} {{ID5}}          |
| 4 Heroes:  | 5 x Giant Rats      | {{ID1}}  {{ID2}} {{ID3}} {{ID4}} {{ID5}} {{ID6}}  |

}}

    
Use these health boxes to mark off damage:
{{damagetable 
|  |  |   |
|:----|:-------------------------------:|:----------:|
| {{ID1}}   | Lizardkin Shaman          | {{hp3}}    | 
| {{ID2}}   | Lizardkin Archer          | {{hp2}}    | 
| {{ID3}}   | Lizardkin Archer          | {{hp2}}    | 
| {{ID4}}   | Lizardkin Warrior         | {{hp3}}    | 
| {{ID5}}   | Lizardkin Archer          | {{hp2}}    | 
| {{ID6}}   | Lizardkin Archer          | {{hp2}}    | 
}}

\column

### Tactics
All of these monsters engage the heroes with melee attacks.  Even with the extra rats this should be an easy fight, but if things get crowded, you can hold a few of the rats off until a couple of the rats have been KO’d.

### Conclusion
Once all of the monsters are KO’d, read this.
{{descriptive
You dispatch the final rat and spend a few moments investigating the caves.  You find that the rat hole connects the small northern cave section with the main cavern.
}}

Again, allow the players to have their heroes take a short rest to recover any damage.
If the players investigate further, read this:

{{descriptive
The horrid smell of rats is strong from the north, and from the south you can hear the faint trickle of water.

}}

Once the players are ready, they can decide which way they want to go:
- Head south to **Encounter 4**
- The north passage to **Encounter 5**


{{footerleft}}{{footercenter}}{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page

## Encounter 4: A Momentary Detour!
This fourth encounter area is actually empty.  Feel free to keep it empty, or to try something like this:
- There’s a monster in the water
- Old man Jenkins has been stuck down here for years
- The water is magical (refills potions, increases strength, something else)
- The heroes see something sparkling at the bottom of the pool of water
- The stalagmites contain the frozen figures of monsters/commoners

### Map

\column

### Encounter Intro
When the heroes enter this area, read this:

{{descriptive
The rocky tunnel turns left and then right before opening into a larger cavern.
The soft blue light from the fungi is reflected in the surface of the pool of water, and the light dances and sparkles on the roof of the cavern.

}}

### Encounter Features

This area has two main features, the pool of water and the stalagmites in the middle of the cavern.

### Ability Tests
Any ability tests that the players can perform are up to you.  Maybe they need to be dexterous to pick up the shiny thing from the bottom of the pool, or maybe a giant tentacle grabs one of the heroes and tries to drag him or her into the water.


{{footerleft}}{{footercenter}}{{pageNumber,auto}}

### Monsters
There may or may not be monsters here, so here are some random boxes for damage!

| {{ID8}}   | Skeleton Shambler          | {{hp1}}    | 
}}

\column

### Tactics
Up to you really.

### Conclusion
If they heroes have had a fight, allow them to rest to recover any damage.

Once the players are ready, they should head back to the north, through the cavern of **Encounter 3**, and onwards to **Encounter 5**.

{{footerleft}}{{footercenter}}{{pageNumber,auto}}

## Encounter 5: Rat Den!
The final encounter is the rats’ den.
This climactic battle sees the heroes defeat the rats and their king rat and rescue Roger.

### Map

\column

### Encounter Intro
When the heroes enter this area, read this:

{{descriptive
The stench of rats is almost overwhelming as you push further down the tunnel.

Ahead of you there is a low ledge, perhaps four feet high, and another ledge further along.

You see mangy rats scurrying back and forth on the ledge and you realize that you have entered their filthy den!
}}

### Encounter Features

The main features of this area are the two ledges, which are easily scaled (but cost 1 extra square of movement), and the rat holes in all of the walls.  The rats can move into these holes and emerge out of any other hole.

### Ability Tests
The players can have their heroes perform a number of ability tests:

- Intelligence tests (Tracking) to see that the rat holes are interconnected.


{{footerleft}}{{footercenter}}{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page




### Monsters
This encounter features the rat king, plus one extra hungry rat for each hero.

| {{ID6}}   | Lizardkin Archer           | {{hp1}}    | 
}}

\column

### Tactics
All of these rats (including the king rat) use melee attacks against the heroes.  If they’ve got room, the rats can retreat into the rat holes and emerge from any of the other holes.

### Conclusion
Once all of the monsters are KO’d, read this:

{{descriptive
After an epic battle you finally strike down the king rat and his horde of stinky vermin.

In the silence you hear muffled cries from one of the rat holes.  You quickly investigate and find Roger hiding in the hole.  He’s dirty and scared, but relieved to see you:

“Thanks guys!  I thought I was a gonner for sure.  I’d got away from those blighters and hid in the hole, but they woulda got me out sooner or later if you guys hadn’t shown up to get me out!”

He gives you a big hug, which you reluctantly accept because he is pretty filthy.

“I reckon you guys deserve an extra serve of ice-cream for at least a whole week!”
}}
